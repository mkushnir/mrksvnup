mrksvnup - A Fast _svnup_ For FreeBSD.
======================================


This program was inspired by pioneering work of John Mehr: [the svnup
utility](http://jcm.dsl.visi.com/freebsd/svnup/), and an earlier
Dag-Erling Sm√∏rgrav's experiment:
[svnsup](http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/des/svnsup/).  My intention
was to resolve some John's utility's problems of resource usage found by
the time of this writing (hopefully it will be improved).  I also wanted
to achieve a faster run time in at least the obvious cases of small
incremental updates.  The John's utility is based on the _main command
set_ of the SVN RA protocol.  This approach, while yields a correct net
result, is probably not the most optimal in terms of performance. It
requires walking through the entire tree regardless of whether it's
actually needed or not, on the local side.  It doesn't make benefit from
on-the-wire compression normally offered by SVN.

The idea was to see how the [official svn](http://subversion.apache.org/)
client completes some simple usage scenarios: checking out a fresh tree,
updating between _source_ and _target_ revisions. The solution I think was
in the direction of Dag-Erling's experiment.

_mrksvnup_ includes a simplified (and limited) implementation of the [SVN
RA protocol][1], and the [svndiff1][2] editor. The supported transports are
currently restricted to the _svn://_ only. The utility behaves more
like a traditional svn client.  It tracks the latest checked out revision
in a dotfile in the root directory.  It then can update to a different
revision _relative to the current one_ using svndiff documents downloaded
from the server. It doesn't delete the files not being tracked on the
remote side (for example, it won't wipe out custom kernel configurations
during update) unless the containing directory was removed on the server.

The _mrksvnup_ utility keeps some  minimal state about each tracked file:
its remote path and the checksum as a key/value pair in a local database.
An update procedure is carried out in two stages: first an _svndiff_
document is obtained given the source and target revisions, and the files
are edited along with this document. When something went wrong, a full
copy of an individual file is checked out from the server using the
_get-file_ svn command.  During this stage each file's remote path and
final checksum is saved in the database.

The next stage can be entered at an option, and performs a double
check of the local tree against the hash database. During this stage the
known tracked files that might possibly be deleted/modified locally, but
not listed remotely in the svndiff document (because they wouldn't
change), will be restored using the _get-file_ command. It takes much
longer, since the local copy of the repository is fully traversed.  In
many cases this stage is not actually needed.  If it is known that the
local files were not moved/removed since the last update, no extra check
is needed. This stage can be turned on using the _-R_ (repair mode)
option. Actually a fresh re-checkout into an empty directory will often be
quicker than this stage.

This program was first written as a proof of concept, mostly in order to
explore the design decision. It can, however, be used in real world tasks.
Since this is my homework, I made no provision for distributing it through
ports, or other packaging systems. It can be built using basic [GNU
autotools][4]. in this program I have used another my library of common
functions (just for my convenience). This can be easily integrated into
a single self-contained project.

Everything is released under 2-clause BSD license.


TODO
====

* Support of different transports: http://, https:// svn+ssh://.
* Portability to other platforms (?).
